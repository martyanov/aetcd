articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/martyanov/aetcd3/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.

* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `aetcd3` for local development.

1. Fork the `aetcd3` repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/aetcd3.git

3. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

5.  Make your changes locally.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and tests for all the supported Python versions::

    $ make PYTHON_BIN=python3.9 lint
    $ make PYTHON_BIN=python3.9 test

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -S -m "Your detailed description of your changes"
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.7 and 3.8. Check
   https://github.com/martyanov/aetcd3/actions
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Generating protobuf stubs
-------------------------

If the upstream protobuf files changes, copy the stubs::

    $ cp etcd/etcdserver/etcdserverpb/*.proto aetcd3/proto/

Then::

    $ make genproto


Cutting new releases
--------------------

The release process to PyPi is automated using travis deploys and bumpversion.

1. Check changes since the last release:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline

2. Bump the version (respecting semver, one of ``major``, ``minor`` or
   ``patch``):

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ git tag -s -a v<version> -m "Release version <version>"

3. Push to github:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ git push
       $ git push --tags

4. Wait for travis tests to run and deploy to PyPI
